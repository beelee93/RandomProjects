#Bee Lee's Random Repo

This repository has source codes to random project ideas that 
popped up out of the blue, possibly during some of my showers or when
I'm pacing about doing nothing. This is just to satisfy my curiousity 
and the codes are not guaranteed to be of good use.

You are free to use them however you like, but I'd prefer some acknowledgement 
if you do so. kthxbai

##1. Dikjstra Visual
A visualization of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on a grid. Press A to start. 
You can see how the algorithm slowly processes through the grid tiles until it discovers the destination
tile. It may fail catastrophically if there is no shortest path available as I did not 
fully test it.

##2. Sorting Algorithms
As a revision for my Algorithms and C++ modules in uni. Implemented the 5 "basic" sorting 
algorithms using the OOP concept of C++.

##3. Prim Visual
A visualization of the Prim's algorithm. Press A to start.
